				<p><strong>Media: Cynthia Williams, Director, First-Year Success Seminar, DAESA, 509-335-7421, <a href="mailto:cindyw@wsu.edu">cindyw@wsu.edu</a></strong></p>
				<p>PULLMAN, Wash.—How would you solve a problem related to “relocation?” More than 250 students enrolled in UNIV 104 (First-Year Success Seminar) have worked on ideas to do just that in small teams this semester.</p>
				<p>Twelve finalist teams will deliver presentations at an <a href="https://adobecreativejams.com/">Adobe-hosted Creative Jam</a> from 6-8 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 3, in the SPARK.</p>
				<p>The university community and the public are invited to attend in person, or <a href=""http://bit.ly/WSUCreativeJamGroup>engage in the Creative Jam remotely</a> through a livestreamed Facebook channel.</p>
				<p><span id="more-620"></span></p>
				<p>Prizes will be presented by <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Fortune 500 tech leader Adobe</a>. Experts from the company have helped mentor teams and provided access to design prototyping tools in its XD product.</p>
				<p>The project kicked off in September, when freshman and sophomore students in 13 sections of UNIV 104 learned details of the class assignment: Develop solutions to problems or issues inherent to any type of relocation.</p>
				<p>Since then, the project has allowed students to work with university experts from the class, the <a href="https://commonreading.wsu.edu/">Common Reading program</a>, and the <a href="https://spark.wsu.edu/creative-corridor/">Creative Corridor</a>, and with the Adobe representatives.</p>
				<p>The students had to employ critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and digital literacy skills to create an app. Using <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe&#8217;s XD software</a>, they wireframed and finally posted their solutions in prototype form. Adobe staff will attend the jam virtually, but WSU and corporate judges will decide which presentations get top awards. </p>
				<p>The WSU class is arguably the largest in the nation to be invited to participate in an Adobe Creative Jam. This year’s effort builds upon previous, smaller-scale jams at WSU, and also sets the tone for a spring 2020 jam featuring a new set of around 200 students enrolled in UNIV 104.</p>
				<p>UNIV 104 is part of the WSU First-Year Programs, a unit of the <a href="https://vpue.wsu.edu/oue">Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement (DAESA)</a>. DAESA is part of the <a href="https://provost.wsu.edu">Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President</a>.</p>

					<h2>About daniel.rieck</h2>
					<p>I earned my PhD in Chemical Engineering at WSU by studying the biophysical nature of the molecular signaling mechanisms that control how the heart pumps blood. During my PhD work, my interest in and affinity for computer science, systems modeling, and visual and written communication blossomed into a new direction toward web development. I now live and breathe to solve problems of design through programming, automation, analysis, and abstraction.</p>
