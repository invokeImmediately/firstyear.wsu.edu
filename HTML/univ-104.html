    <h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <dl class="faq toggled">
        <dt>What can I expect in University 104?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p class="oue-normal">In your First-Year Success Seminar, you can expect <strong>a small class size, many opportunities to get to know your classmates in small group discussions, and opportunities to get connected with the parts of campus that you care about most</strong>. You will be involved in the Common Reading Program, reading the book and attending presentations on campus that relate to this year’s book and theme. Maybe most importantly, this course will help you to make meaningful connections between what is important to you and your opportunities at WSU. Work in this course will help go from simply being a student to being a more self-directed learner.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Does taking UNIV 104 make a difference in students’ success?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p class="oue-normal">Yes! Taking a First-Year Success Seminar <strong>will give your structured opportunities (and academic credit) for doing the work that every student must do in order to make a successful transition to college</strong>. Some of these tasks include thinking about time management, considering your reasons for attending WSU, discovering what holds value for you, setting goals and taking steps in your first semester toward reaching them. Data show that students who engage in the course material earn higher GPAs in their first semester and are more likely to return than those who did not take the course.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>How do I enroll in UNIV 104?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p class="oue-normal"><strong>When you register for classes at summer Alive! or fall orientation, your advisor will help you</strong> select a seminar section that will work with your schedule. The courses meet only twice a week for 50 minutes</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Am I required to take UNIV 104? Does it count toward graduation?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p class="oue-normal"><strong>Students are not required to enroll University 104</strong>, and in fact there are only seats for limited number of the freshman class to enroll. The course <strong>will count as an elective toward your 120-credit bachelor’s degree</strong>, and should be considered a 2-credit investment toward your continued success. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What if I don’t take UNIV 104 in my first semester? Can I take it later?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p class="oue-normal"><strong>Ideally, students take the Success Seminar in their first semester.</strong> If a student wants to take it in the spring, some limited number of seats are available in sections intended for freshmen admitted in Spring. Students are not permitted to enroll in the course after they have completed 30 hours of credit. If you are interested in entering a spring section or need an exception, you can contact Leslie Jo Sena, the program coordinator at <a href="mailto:senal@wsu.edu">senal@wsu.edu</a></p>
