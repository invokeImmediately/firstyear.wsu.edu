				<p class="staff-name">Karen Weathermon</p>
				<p class="staff-title">Director</p>
				<p class="staff-unit">First-Year Programs</p>

				<p class="staff-bio">“What is your major going to be?” It’s a question first-year students are asked all the time. Finding the area of study that speaks to your passions and abilities will certainly be a central part of your university experience. But WSU also offers an amazing breadth of opportunities that will surround, broaden, and deepen the major you choose. Making connections—to people, to resources, to experiences, and to a wide array of perspectives—is my passion and also my goal for WSU students. Your first year at WSU is when you begin exploring all the connections that will make you a person who can act with creativity and ingenuity in our complex world. We in First-Year Programs welcome you on this journey of rich connections and exciting possibilities!</p>

				<h4 class="content-revealed">Karen's Bio</h4>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Weathermon is passionate about, and long experienced in, the field of education. With a background that includes secondary and university teaching, she has developed and/or directed a number of WSU programs over a quarter-century that serve all undergraduates, regardless of major or grade. The foundation for her work has been her conviction that learning is about building connections.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Education is sort of a family tradition for Weathermon. Both her parents were teachers; her father was superintendent of schools in Pullman, and in the Philippines at the International School Manila, where she graduated.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">The International Baccalaureate courses at ISM inspired her. They brought topics to life by focusing on complex issues from multiple disciplinary perspectives that proved to be “fascinating, exhilarating, and challenging,” she says. For example, Sophocles’s tragedy “Oedipus Rex” was illuminated by simultaneous lessons on ancient Greek history and architecture as well as modern archaeology and dramatics.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">“It took many years for me to fully understand the impact that groundwork has had on my teaching and administrative philosophy. Simply stated, I believe that learning is a connective act, and that the art of teaching and administrating is fostering a multitude of connections.” She believes more than ever in this purposeful teaching strategy: integrated learning.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Weathermon cultivated her appreciation of integrated learning throughout her own higher education. As an undergraduate at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Wash., she completed her general education requirements through an integrated studies program in addition to earning her B.A. in English. She pursued graduate education at WSU, earning her M.A. and Ph.D. in English with emphases in composition, rhetoric, and American literature.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Her continuing interests in integrated learning are evidenced throughout her career with the nationally ranked WSU Writing Program and general education/university common requirements programs, and most recently with First-Year Programs.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Since 2006, she has led the WSU First-Year Focus living-learning community program while also co-directing the university’s inaugural Common Reading Program. Both focus on learning experiences for freshmen within and beyond classrooms, incorporating collaborative roles for professors, librarians, and residence hall staff. This multitude of connections create the structure for freshmen to have a more holistic and integrated entry into college, while also affording professional development opportunities for faculty and staff. Both programs are also key parts of the WSU First-Year Experience.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Her pioneering and successful efforts at WSU have drawn national attention. She was invited to a seat on the new Washington Learning Communities Consortium (of which she is now a co-chair), membership on the editorial board of the Learning Communities Research and Practice peer-reviewed e-journal, and membership on the Common Readings advisory board for Penguin Random House Academics.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">In 2012, she received a national award as Outstanding First-Year Advocate from the National Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition. </p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">In addition to her passion for her work at WSU, Weathermon also enjoys being an active citizen of the university, attending—often with her 14-year-old son—a wide variety of university events, lectures, and performances. “A university like WSU presents a whole universe of ideas,” she says, “and it is exciting to continue to learn, enjoy, and be changed by so many opportunities!” </p>

				<p class="staff-name">Leslie Jo Sena</p>
				<p class="staff-title">Assistant Director</p>
				<p class="staff-unit">First-Year Programs</p>
				<p class="staff-contact"><a href="mailto:senal@wsu.edu" target="_blank">senal@wsu.edu</a></p>
				<p class="staff-bio">I enjoy working to support student success because when I was teaching writing, I found that that it was “students developing connections to campus and personal resilience in the face of major changes” that allowed them to be successful in classes (mine and others’), rather than the writing instruction that they were receiving. I felt like as much as students learned in English 101 about writing, at least of equal value to them was the small-class size and learning-community aspects of my class. I am passionate about student success and wanted to be in a position where I could develop those aspects more deeply.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio more content-hidden no-btm-margin"><strong>Hover/tap to read more about Leslie</strong></p>
				<h4 class="content-revealed">Leslie's Bio</h4>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Sena has devoted more than a decade of her professional career in education to first-year and other students at WSU. She taught several courses in the English Composition program and is increasingly and extensively involved in building out the First-Year Experience, part of WSU Undergraduate Education. The opportunity to serve as both a faculty member and administrator aligns with two philosophies that guide her: education is a tool for personal and societal growth, and “the first year matters.”</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Valuing education above all is something Sena had to grow into. Her says own undergraduate years at Colorado State University and Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas, progressed in “fits and starts” and that she didn’t “fall in love with my education” until she was a master’s student at WSU working with undergraduates in the writing classroom. She enjoyed the students and processes so much that she switched her field altogether, from American Studies focused on labor history, civil rights, literature, and history, to English Rhetoric and Composition.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Sena credits her father—an “old-school science professor”—with instilling in her the beliefs that one should do things for the pure knowledge gained rather than for industry or profit, and that one should question classroom practices are effective and meeting goals.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">She says her work as an instructor “made me passionate about student success,” and additional service to the Common Reading Program and the First-Year Focus living-learning community—two parts of the First-Year Experience—has allowed her to explore the subject of program effectiveness.</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">“In 2007, I volunteered to do a large-scale assessment of the Common Reading Program, since no one else, nationally, was assessing these programs. My approach has always been to understand what the desired outcomes are, imagine what we might do to enact those outcomes, and then assess our progress. If we’re doing something that is helping students to grow, great. If not, we try new things.”</p>
				<p class="staff-bio content-revealed">Her analyses confirmed that students who participate in the program do see benefits, including an enhanced sense of community and belonging, and being able to see how different viewpoints can be used to examine a complex problem. She, with program co-director Karen Weathermon and others, has shared findings at national conference workshops and poster events.</p>
