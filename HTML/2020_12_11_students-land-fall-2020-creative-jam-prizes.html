				<p>“Thanks to our ongoing partnership with Adobe, our students were once again able to demonstrate the skills learned in UNIV 104 to creatively identify and communicate their innovative solutions to a complex problem,” said Williams. UNIV 104 is part of First-Year Programs, a unit in the <a href="https://daesa.wsu.edu/">Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement</a> in the <a href="https://provost.wsu.edu/">provost’s office</a>.</p>
				<p>The fall 2020 Jam’s first-place winners are Sidney Serna, Ashley Driesler, and Isabella Croston, for their app “Unbottle.” They will receive a 12-month subscription to Adobe Stock’s collection of images, graphics, videos, 3D objects, and templates and Creative Jam backpacks full of swag.<span id="more-708"></span></p>
				<p>Second-place winners are Maryann Hanes, Blake Jones, and Niel Wright, for their app “Concord.” They will receive a 12-month subscription to Adobe Stock as well as Creative Jam swag.</p>
				<p>Third-place winners are Miriam Padilla Castaneda, Max Baer, and Lauren Kauper, for their app “Vital Mood.” They will receive a 12-month subscription to Adobe Stock plus Creative Jam swag.</p>
				<p>The top eight teams will receive a 12-month student subscription to the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Creative Cloud</a> <em>online</em> collection of more than 20 desktop and mobile apps and services for photography, design, video, web, UX, and more.</p>
				<h3>Top Team’s Experience</h3>
				<p>“We as a team knew we wanted to make a self-help app,” said Serna. “We all had different ideas how to go about creating it, but I really emphasized creating an app where people can come together and just talk about their past experiences.”</p>
				<p>“My favorite part of this experience was honestly gaining access to such a cool program and having the time to play around with the software on my own as well as creating an app design that I could see being genuinely helpful for people of all backgrounds,” said Driesler.</p>
				<p>Samantha Solomon, the team’s UNIV 104 instructor, said, “Sidney, Ashley, and Isabella’s project stood out because it embodied the theme of ‘resilience’ by demonstrating a real need for students to confront issues they are dealing with during these stressful times with COVID and remote learning.</p>
				<p>“They worked really hard to create a unique, user-friendly app that responded to our current environment, and put a positive spin on it. Their fellow students and the Adobe Jam judges clearly related to it,” said Solomon. “I could absolutely see myself using it!”</p>
				<h3>Developing Career-ready Skills</h3>
				<p>“This project allows students to develop in-demand career-ready skills such as complex problem-solving, project management, teamwork, professionalism, and public presentation while also engaging with course themes in a novel way,” said Williams. “Developing their apps around an important theme, and later presenting that work to peers and expert judges, allows students to see their work in a real-world context, and to learn new skills that can be used later in their college education or in a future career.”</p>
				<p>“Every semester students’ submissions have become stronger, reflecting revisions to the project made through the ongoing partnership between WSU and Adobe,” said Karen Weathermon, director of First-Year Programs. “This semester’s theme of resilience resulted in projects that were especially striking at providing students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of core concepts covered in the course.”</p>
				<p>Some of the fall topics addressing the theme included stress management, academic discourse, study skills, and self-care tips.</p>
